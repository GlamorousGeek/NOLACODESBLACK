# NOLACODESBLACK
29 days of short coding projects that will have you coding by the end of Black History Month. 

This challenge is to gain some coding experience. Goal is to spend everyday in February learning how to code. We'll give you the basics to get you inspired. Use as much Black, Green,Red and Purple in your designs as possible y'all!

You'll want to use CodePen(https://codepen.io/) to host your projects.

After you've created your own piece of Black History use the hashtag #nolacodesblack to be featured in our IG stories Follow @NolavateBlack on IG and like the page on Facebook
